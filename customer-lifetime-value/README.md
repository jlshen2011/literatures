# cltv-literature

A curated list of literatures on modeling customer lifetime value (CLTV). 

## What is CLTV

CLTV is the total financial contribution from the current period into the future — that is, revenues minus costs - of a customer over his/her future lifetime with the company. It measures the worth of a customer to the firm.

## Why CLTV

* Focusing on CLV leads to a customer orientation
* It places emphasis on future (vs current) profitability instead of share or sales. 
* It helps a firm assess the profitability of individual customers, and provides greater insight than traditional financial metrics.
* It helps targeting customers more efficiently through customized offerings. 
* It provides a structured approach to forecasting future cash flows that can be better than using a simple extrapolation approach as is commonly used in finance.
